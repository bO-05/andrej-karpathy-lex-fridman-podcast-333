# Tesla's AI Endeavors

In this section, we'll dive into Andrej Karpathy's work on AI at Tesla, focusing on two key areas: autonomous driving and the Optimus humanoid robot project. Karpathy, who served as the Director of AI at Tesla from 2017 to 2022, played a crucial role in advancing the company's AI capabilities and pushing the boundaries of what's possible in these domains.

Tesla's approach to AI is unique in many ways, characterized by a strong emphasis on *vertical integration*, *large-scale data collection*, and *continuous iteration*. By developing hardware, software, and data infrastructure in-house, Tesla has been able to create AI systems that are optimized for its specific use cases and can be rapidly improved over time.

One of the key insights from Karpathy's work at Tesla is the importance of building AI systems that can learn from vast amounts of real-world data. Rather than relying solely on simulated environments or hand-labeled datasets, Tesla's AI models are trained on massive datasets collected from its fleet of vehicles and other sources.
